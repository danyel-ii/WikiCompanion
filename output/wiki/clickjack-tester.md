# Clickjack Tester

## Overview
Clickjack Tester is a web application security tool that appears across web application security workflows in this knowledge base. It is referenced as part of higher-level security analysis, investigation, monitoring, or validation activity rather than as an end in itself.

## What It Is
Clickjack Tester is best understood as a web-application-security tool in this knowledge base. Its role is conceptual and system-facing rather than procedural: it gives analysts or defenders a structured way to examine evidence, model system behavior, or reason about security state.

## How It Works
Clickjack Tester works by turning technical inputs into more interpretable outputs at the system level. Across the source skills, it appears as part of larger analysis, investigation, monitoring, or validation loops rather than as a standalone end state.

## Core Concepts
- penetration testing
- clickjacking
- ui redressing
- web security
- owasp
- x frame options
- web application security

## Typical Workflow
- Examine response headers for anti-clickjacking defenses.

## Use Cases
- During authorized penetration tests when assessing UI redressing vulnerabilities
- When testing whether sensitive actions (delete account, transfer funds, change settings) can be performed via clickjacking
- For evaluating the effectiveness of X-Frame-Options and Content-Security-Policy frame-ancestors directives
- When assessing applications that process one-click actions without additional confirmation
- During security audits of applications handling financial transactions or account management

## Limitations
- Output still depends on context, data quality, and surrounding analysis.
- The tool should be interpreted as part of a broader workflow, not as a complete answer by itself.
- Capabilities and visibility vary depending on environment, integrations, and available inputs.
