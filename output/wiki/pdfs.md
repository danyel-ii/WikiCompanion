# Pdfs

## Overview
Pdfs is a detection tool that appears across ransomware defense workflows in this knowledge base. It is referenced as part of higher-level security analysis, investigation, monitoring, or validation activity rather than as an end in itself.

## What It Is
Pdfs is best understood as a ransomware-defense tool in this knowledge base. Its role is conceptual and system-facing rather than procedural: it gives analysts or defenders a structured way to examine evidence, model system behavior, or reason about security state.

## How It Works
Pdfs works by turning technical inputs into more interpretable outputs at the system level. Across the source skills, it appears as part of larger analysis, investigation, monitoring, or validation loops rather than as a standalone end state.

## Core Concepts
- ransomware
- detection
- honeypot
- canary
- defense
- deception
- ransomware defense

## Typical Workflow

## Use Cases
- Deploying early-warning detection for ransomware encryption attempts using canary files
- Creating honeypot file shares that detect lateral movement and data staging before encryption
- Supplementing EDR and SIEM-based detection with deception-layer alerts that have near-zero false positives
- Detecting ransomware variants that evade signature-based detection by triggering on file modification behavior
- Validating that ransomware detection capabilities work by testing with controlled encryption tools
- Placing canary files only in root directories where ransomware may skip them by targeting subdirectories first
- Using obvious canary names that sophisticated ransomware may recognize and avoid

## Limitations
- Output still depends on context, data quality, and surrounding analysis.
- The tool should be interpreted as part of a broader workflow, not as a complete answer by itself.
- Capabilities and visibility vary depending on environment, integrations, and available inputs.
