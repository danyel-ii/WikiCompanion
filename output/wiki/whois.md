# Whois

## Overview
Whois is a forensics tool that appears across digital forensics workflows in this knowledge base. It is referenced as part of higher-level security analysis, investigation, monitoring, or validation activity rather than as an end in itself.

## What It Is
Whois is best understood as a digital-forensics tool in this knowledge base. Its role is conceptual and system-facing rather than procedural: it gives analysts or defenders a structured way to examine evidence, model system behavior, or reason about security state.

## How It Works
Whois works by turning technical inputs into more interpretable outputs at the system level. Across the source skills, it appears as part of larger analysis, investigation, monitoring, or validation loops rather than as a standalone end state.

## Core Concepts
- forensics
- email analysis
- phishing
- spf
- dkim
- dmarc
- header analysis
- digital forensics
- OSINT
- Maltego
- Shodan
- Recon ng

## Typical Workflow
- /cases/case-2024-001/email/
- Target: threat actor group, malicious domain, IP range, or organization
- Priority Intelligence Requirements (PIRs): What specific questions need answering?
- Legal authority: Passive OSINT is legal; active probing requires authorization
- Data handling: TLP classification for collected intelligence
- -H "apikey: YOUR_KEY"
- whois -h whois.arin.net evil-domain.com

## Use Cases
- When investigating a suspected phishing email to determine its true origin
- For verifying sender authenticity and detecting email spoofing
- During incident response when a user has clicked a phishing link
- When tracing the delivery path and relay servers of a suspicious email
- For validating SPF, DKIM, and DMARC alignment to identify forgery
- Investigating external infrastructure associated with a phishing campaign targeting your organization
- Enriching threat actor profiles with publicly observable indicators (WHOIS, ASN data, SSL certificates)
- Conducting authorized attack surface discovery to understand your organization's external exposure

## Limitations
- Output still depends on context, data quality, and surrounding analysis.
- The tool should be interpreted as part of a broader workflow, not as a complete answer by itself.
- Capabilities and visibility vary depending on environment, integrations, and available inputs.
